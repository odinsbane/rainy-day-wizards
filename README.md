Proof of concept for a wizard game. The idea is that it is a
small game that can be played simply by clicking and some gestures.

There isn't a story line, yet. Nor is there much of a mechanism to
create a story line.

## Basic game play

Click on the map and the wizard tries to move there. Right click on the
map and the wizard casts a fire ball towards the point clicked.

Casting more complicated spells involves using a gesture. There are two
more complicated spells: The shield, which is a move to the right, then
move back to the left. The ring of fire, move to the right, then circle
around the top to the left.

## Map creation

There is a map editor, that allows somebody to create a map with tree's
and rocks. From there, the map can be used by creating a new scenerio.

## Development

Development should follow a story, tools development process. As in
start creating some plausible scenarios to play through and learn
the game dynamics. As the scenario progresses, then new features
can be added and improved as necessary to complete the scenario.

In this vane the default scenario has been completed, which has three
maps, and some tasks. Even at this stage there are plenty of issues to
complete along with overall polish.

I think this could turn into a fun/small type of game, but nothing too
serious.

Collaboration would be welcome.

## Google Code

This was migrated from google code, and that is where some of the
resources can still be found, https://code.google.com/archive/p/rainy-day-wizards/
All of the graphics/sprites and maps for the first scenerio are found there.
